Example 1
    based on Jaynes, pp 

'''
    There are 11 balls in an urn; 7 are white (type a) and 4 are red (type b). The balls have 
    unique labels and are identical except for color and label. The Principle of Indifference
    applies. Five (5) balls are pulled at random from the urn.
    
    
permutation ==  a sequence of entities (not exchangeable)

combination ==  a group of entities (exchangeable)

bin collection == a type of combination (eg, 3 type a and 2 type b) in a combination of 5 entities)




---- W?O REPLACEMENT --------------------------------------  
    (1) 
    Observation Level I: 
        Can discern unique label AND color on each ball.
    Atomic Outcome: 
        The pull of one (1) single ball from the urn; W/O REPLACEMENT
        Each ball is a unique entity (per label on entity) with additional characteristics
        (here, type a or type b)
    Collective Outcome: 
        A single, time-based sequence of five (5) atomic outcomes as a unique permutation
        of labeled entities. The members of the complete set of permutations/sequences are 
        mutually exclusive and exhaustive(MEE) per the observation level
    Collective Outcome Space Cts:
        11 options for the first draw (t1)
        10 options for the second draw (t2)
        9 options for the third draw (t3)
        8 options for the fourth draw (t4)
        7 options for the fifth draw (t5)
        
        n!/(n-r)!
        11!/(11-5)! = 11!/6! = 11*10*9*8*7 = 55440 ct of unique sequences of labeled entities
    
        # Verification: breaking it down by bin collections of characteristics (type a and type b)
        # Possible combinations or bin collections (of characteristics) are:
        5 type a ; 0 type b ==> 7C5 * 4C0 * 5! = 21*120    = 2520
        4 type a ; 1 type b ==> 7C4 * 4C1 * 5! = 35*4*120  = 16800
        3 type a : 2 type b ==> 7C3 * 4C2 * 5! = 35*6*120  = 25200
        2 type a : 3 type b ==> 7C2 * 4C3 * 5! = 21*4*120  = 10080
        1 type a : 4 type b ==> 7C1 * 4C4 * 5! = 7*1*120   = 840
        
                                                SUM         = 55440
        
        There are 5! = 120 permutations for each possible combination or bin collection
        Thus, 
        (120)(21+140+210+84+7) = 55440


 (2) 
 Observational Level II: 
     Can discern ONLY the color of each ball OR labels are not important
 Atomic Outcome:
     The pull of one (1) single ball from the urn; W/O REPLACEMENT
     Each ball is still a unique entity (per label) with additional characteristics
     (type a or type b) but only characteristics are important or observeable; labels are 
     of secondary importance
 Collective Outcome: 
     A time-based sequence of five (5) atomic outcomes as a combination 
     of type a and type b cts. The members of the complete set of combinations are mutually 
     exclusive and exhaustive (MEE) per the observation level
     
     nCr
     11C5 = 11!/5!6! = 462 ct of combination in the complete set of  
     
 Collective Outcome Space Cts:
     5 type a ; 0 type b ==> 7C5              = 21
     4 type a ; 1 type b ==> 7C4 * 4C1 = 35*4 = 140
     3 type a : 2 type b ==> 7C3 * 4C2 = 35*6 = 210
     2 type a : 3 type b ==> 7C2 * 4C3 = 21*4 = 84
     1 type a : 4 type b ==> 7C1 * 4C4 = 7 * 1 = 7
                                         SUM == 462
                                         
     21+140+210+84+7 = 462


---- W/ REPLACEMENT -------------------------------------------

    (3)
    Observation Level I: 
        Can discern time-stamp label AND color on each ball.
    Atomic Outcome: 
        The pull of one (1) single ball from the urn; W/ REPLACEMENT
        Each ball is a unique entity (per time-stamp label) with additional characteristics
        (here, type a or type b)
     Collective Outcome: 
        A single, time-based sequence of five (5) atomic outcomes as a unique permutation
        of labeled entities. The members of the complete set of permutations/sequences are 
        mutually exclusive and exhaustive(MEE) per the observation level
    Collective Outcome Space Cts:
        11 options for the first draw
        11 options for the second draw
        11 options for the third draw
        11 options for the fourth draw
        11 options for the fifth draw
        
        11^5 = 11**5 = 161051 unique sequences of time-stamped labeled entities
        
        (n+r-1)!/(n-1)!(r)!
        (11+5-1)!/(10)!(5)! = 15!/10!5! = 3003 types of bin collections 
       
        
        This creates a time-based set of replicates of the original set.
        There are five (5) replicate sets of the original set  bc there are five (5) 
        draws/ slots  per sequence:
            
            t1      a1.1 a2.1 a3.1 a4.1 a5.1 a6.1 a7.1  b8.1 b9.1 b10.1 b11.1

        At each time step there is the options to fill the current slot in the sequence with
        any member of this time-based set.

        NB. Although there are 7 type a and 4 type b cts in the urn, the lack of entity 
        uniqueness (ie, labels) coupled with the abibility to generate replacemnts contracts the
        set of entities to simply {a, b}, or one, type a ct and one, type b ct

    What are all of the observable outcomes that are possible given that 
    there are no unique labels on the balls? That is, how many observable 
    are possible regardless of whether the balls carry unique labels or not. The observable
    outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (MEE) 
    
     
       

    (2) Q: Iff the balls carried unique labels AND a single outcome is defined as drawing 
    five balls from the urn, one after the other,  and placing them sequentially in order 
    in a set of 5 slots, how many unique sequences could be genrated? The sequences are
    NOT exchangeable because the resolution of observability is at the level of the
    labels, regardless of other characteristics of the balls.
    A: There would be 11 options for drawing the first ball, 10 options for drawing the 
    second ball, 9 options for drawing the third ball,..., and 7 options for drawing the 
    fifth ball. 
    
    
    ct of possible unique sequences = 11! / (11-5)!
