\subsubsection{The Problem of Induction and Inference}
The central question here is: when, if ever, is it possible for science to successfully generalize from experience thereby creating empirical knowledge? Put another way, Is it possible to make valid scientific inferences using induction? The term \enquote*{empirical knowledge} in this context means the creation of hypotheses (natural laws) from which true predictions can be made. And the term \enquote*{inductive logic} is typically applied to the entire process from observation through generalization to hypothesis although the modern treatment of induction is more complicated \cite{vickers_problem_2016}. Whether or not science actually produces knowledge by inductivism is an old debate reaching back at least to David Hume's indictment (1739) of Francis Bacon's \textit{Novum Organum Scientiarum} (1620).\\

Today, it appears that inductive inference is generally accepted in scientific work without much reflection. Not that this is necessarily an unhelpful or difficult philosophical stance because,
\begin{myindentpar}{3em}
Deductive inference can never support contingent judgments such as meteorological forecasts, nor can deduction alone explain the breakdown of one's car, discover the genotype of a new virus, or reconstruct fourteenth century trade routes. Inductive inference can do these things more or less successfully because, in Peirce's phrase, inductions are ampliative. Induction can amplify and generalize our experience, broaden and deepen our empirical knowledge. Deduction on the other hand is explicative. Deduction orders and rearranges our knowledge without adding to its content \cite{vickers_problem_2016}.
\end{myindentpar}

In fact, in virtually all fields of inquiry modern inductive inference is readily accepted as the application of the statistics and experimental design algorithms of the Fischer-Neyman-Pearson school of statistical inference. The outputs from these algorithms are then used as the support structures for investigative, scientific conclusions. But such standard mechanisms of statistical inference are but one of three options to the solution of induction and inference for the modern researcher, the second being Bayesian statistics, and the last Karl Popper's falsification (the hypothetico-deductive method).\\

This paper examines the essentials of the solution to the problem of induction and inference as reasoned by Sir Harold Jeffreys (1891-1989), Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in the University of Cambridge. A genteel mathematician, statistician, geophysicist, and astronomer, Sir Harold is considered a founding member of the Bayesian camp of inference. The evolution to the now-considered standard statistical approach to inference (i.e., Fischer-Neyman-Pearson statistics) may well be due to the differences in the personalities of Sir Harold Jeffreys and Sir Ronald Fischer, rather than in any inherent gain in inductive power from the Fischerian approach. \citeA{jaynes_probability_2003} have argued that the Bayesian approach, which uses non-frequentist probability theory as the basis for the logic of science, permits a much broader and more useful approach to inference. Noteworthy is the fact that falsificationism discounts and dismisses both the current standard and the Bayesian approach to induction because neither is able to sort good inductive inferences from bad \cite{miller_critical_1994}.

\subsubsection{The Nature of Scientific Inference}
A scientific inference is here defined as any statement (summary, hypothesis, law, proposition, or conclusion) that is made beyond the empirical, recorded data. Under Jeffreys, scientific inference is conceptually quite simple: from the observations, state the inferences in the simplest, most general form possible \enquote{and modify them as later experience dictates}. According to Jeffreys \enquote{not only is this process free from self-contradiction, but ... it is the only method possible}\cite[p.~14]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. \citeA{jaynes_probability_2003} provide a typology of inductive inference using the weaker syllogisms (If A is true then B is true. (1) B is true therefore A is more plausible; (2) A is false therefore B is less plausible.) And Carnap has provided a taxonomy of the varieties of inductive inference (direct inference, predictive inference, inference by analogy, inverse inference, universal inference)\cite{vickers_problem_2016}.\\

A scientific inference defines a logical relation or connection between the data and the statement of inference. The nature of this logical relation needs careful attention because it is here, in the first step of inference making that the potential for grave mental error creeps in. Jaynes refers to such mental error in inference as \enquote{the mind projection fallacy} \cite[p.~92]{jaynes_probability_2003}. Specifically, the logical relation or connection is not deductive nor is it necessarily causal. A logical relation or connection is an inference that can propagate equally well either forwards or backwards in time. A causal inference, however, propagates only forwards. Given this framing, it is very clear that scientific inference reflects only probabilistic states of knowledge about reality in the mind of the scientist. Such states of knowledge, ultimately, may come to be understood as causal relations in light of evidence \cite[p.~5, 62, 92]{jaynes_probability_2003}. The potential mental error is natural because logical and causal inferences are easily conflated. For example, my measurements and evaluations of this year's almond crop may provide some logical inference regarding this year's cherry crop but there is no causal link between the almond and cherry crops. Similarly, the condensed summary provided by a data curve-fitting exercise neither dictates causality nor creates a scientific inference: pickle sales may show a lovely linear relationship to divorce rates but a causal relationship is unlikely, and an empirical equation generated from time vs. displacement data is insufficient to assert (predict) displacement at any future time. Conversely, archeology, geology, and paleontology are only made possible because recent discovery can completely overturn what was believed to have transpired eons ago. Similarly, old datasets may be completely re-interpreted in light of new logical relationships.\\

\subsubsection{Probability Theory as the Engine of Scientific Inference}
For Jeffreys, scientific inference is realized with probability theory, the calculus of inductive reasoning. Explicitly,
\begin{myindentpar}{3em}
Our fundamental hypothesis is that degrees of confirmation of different propositions, on the same data, can be put in order, that our fundamental type of comparison is of the form \enquote*{on data \textit{p}, \textit{q} is more probable than \textit{r}} \cite[p.~25]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}.
\end{myindentpar}
Jeffreys argues that the relation between a dataset and a statement of inference is, in fact, probability. Alternatively, probability is defined by Jeffreys as multi-valued logic; not in any way related to the frequencies in \enquote*{random experiments} (the Frequentist position). The idea is that probability is a form of propositional logic that expresses degrees of reasonable belief and thus provides the appropriate scale between deductive proof and deductive disproof (falsification). Restating Carnap's three axioms as the logical foundations of probability, Jeffreys derives the basic sum and product rules and makes two very important points regarding the use of probability theory as the engine of scientific inference. \\

First, the data used for scientific inference must not be self-contradictory. A self-contradiction assumes impossible conditions which, for Jeffreys, means that there has been a poor translation or an incorrect framing of a scientific question. Scientific inference is impossible in self-contradictory data.\\

Second, it is crucial to recognize \enquote{that \enquote*{\textit{q} has probability 0 given \textit{p}} is not the same thing as \enquote*{\textit{p} entails $\sim $ \textit{q}}. (\textit{p} entails $ \sim $ \textit{q}) entails P(\textit{q} $\lvert $ \textit{p}) = 0; the converse is not true}\cite[p.~30]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. This second point seems a bit tricky. It proposes to differentiate between verified Truth and verisimilitude in the context of scientific practice and may be related to Jeffreys' notion of causality in science. Jeffreys is quite harsh with causality. He denies the determinism that follows from the so-called \enquote*{Principle of Causality} or \enquote*{Uniformity of Nature} because even in its mildest form (the invariable succession of events) \enquote{we do not know of any particular succession that it will always be invariable and we need also to deal with successions that have not been so}\cite[p.~203]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. Again, Jeffreys own words are best,
\begin{myindentpar}{3em}
The argument in this book completely reverses the usual notion of causality. This started with some idea of inherent necessity. After Mach it was replaced by invariable succession, but in fact invariable succession is rare. We now see that science starts with the fact that variation exists and proceeds by first considering the hypothesis that it is random and detecting in succession departures from randomness \cite[p.~262]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}.
\end{myindentpar}
and
\begin{myindentpar}{3em}
On the present view the classical view of causality is inverted. Instead of saying that every event has a cause, we recognize that observations vary and regard scientific method as a procedure for analysing the variation. Our starting point is to consider all variation as random; then successive significance tests warrant the treatment of more and more of it as predictable, and we explicitly regard the method as one of successive approximation.\cite[p.~81]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}.
\end{myindentpar}
Clearly, Jeffreys advocates for scientific progress as ever-better approximations to Truth and in so doing, implies that the goal of scientific inference is to identify and verify potential causal relations by forming a judgment about the likely truth or falsity of a statement (summary, hypothesis, law, proposition, or conclusion) given all of the evidence at hand. This subsequently implies that successful identification and verification of causal relations is directly proportional to successful predictions, or put another way, predictability entails causality.\\

Enter Bayes Theorem or as Jeffreys calls it, the principle of inverse probability. Jeffreys cites four special cases where \enquote{we can see its relation to scientific inference at once} \cite[p.~31]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. Of note is the special case of the \enquote*{crucial test}. Given \textit{p} is all of the background information (including previously obtained datasets) that forms the basis for generating the hypotheses, $ \theta $ is an additional dataset, and $ q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \dots q_{n}$ is a set of exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses, Bayes provides,
\begin{equation*}
P(q_{r}\lvert \theta \cdot p) = \ddfrac{P(q_{r}\lvert p)P(\theta\lvert q_{r} \cdot p)}{\sum_{r=1}^{n}P(q_{r}\lvert p)P(\theta\lvert q_{r} \cdot p)}
\end{equation*}
or equivalently,
\begin{equation*}
Posterior \ probability = \ddfrac{Prior \ probability \ x \ Likelihood}{Evidence}
\end{equation*}
The crucial test is such that if the prior probabilities of all of the $ q_{r}$ are comparable, and $ \theta $ has small probability on all of the hypotheses except for a large probability on one of them, say on $ q_1 $, then the posterior probability of this one hypothesis ($ q_1 $) may be very close to one. This hypothesis would likely be judged as very likely true. If, on the other hand, the posterior probability of $ q_1 $ was close to 0.5, there would not be sufficient evidence to either confirm or reject the hypothesis and more evidence would be called for.

\subsubsection{A Postulate, a Theorem, and a Problem}
Jeffreys supplements the use of probability theory for scientific inference with a postulate and a theorem and then considers the problem of prior probabilities. Jeffreys' simplicity postulate is this: \enquote {the set of all possible forms of scientific laws is finite and enumerable and their initial (prior) probabilities form the terms of a convergent series of sum 1}\cite[p.~38]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. This postulate effectively translates to the idea that simpler statements are more probable in the absence of observational evidence; conversely, complexity decreases a statement's prior probability. The simplicity postulate is required to help arbitrate among prior probabilities (see below).\\

His theorem, derived from Bayes, suggests that researchers should look for opportunities to make highly precise inferences (as predictions) because \enquote{the further we get from the original data the more informative a verification is}\cite[p.~40]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. The idea is simply that if detailed predictions can be made and verified, they will provide a tremendous evidence boost to a specific hypothesis.\\

Finally, Jeffreys acknowledges the problem of priors. The main arguments against the use of prior (initial) probabilities are that they are arbitrary and inconsistent. Jeffreys answers these criticisms first, by saying that true, priors can be assigned consistently in many different ways. What is required only is that all assigned priors have positive probability on the background information. Thus, arbitrary means only the option of multiple, consistent assignments. Second, Jeffreys states that priors are necessary because they are fundamental to the logical construct of the calculus of inductive reasoning. Any logical system must have a starting point. Here, the starting point requires scientists to face the question, What were the probabilities of your hypothesis before you had any observational data at all? Or equally, What is your reasonable belief concerning your hypothesis based on your background information?\\

To assist in the selection and definition of priors, Jeffreys makes an appeal to a \enquote*{working rule} suggested by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead in the \textit{Principia Mathematica}. Simply put, the rule says that statements like scientific laws and hypotheses should be classified by form. Once done, selection of one form over another should be based on simplicity because the simpler the form, the more general it is. As Jeffreys points out, adoption of the working rule means that \enquote{when there is a choice of axioms we should choose the one that enables the greatest number of inferences to be drawn} \cite[p.~34]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}. According to Jeffreys, the real problem here is not whether priors are arbitrary or consistent, but rather to find the most suitable selection of priors. Jaynes agrees stating, \enquote{there is no universal rule for assigning priors -- the conversion of verbal prior information into numerical prior probabilities is an open-ended problem of logical analysis}\cite[p. ~88]{jaynes_probability_2003}.

\subsection{Conclusions}
Inference is the bedrock of science. For Sir Harold Jeffreys, scientific inference is obtained with induction powered by Bayes Theorem and (non-frequentist) probability theory. Sir Harold sees scientific progress as the ever-better, successive approximations that can be made with induction and reminds us \enquote{that induction has often failed in the past but progress in science is very largely the consequence of direct attention to instances where the inductive method has led to incorrect predictions.}\cite[p.~14]{jeffreys_scientific_1973}.
