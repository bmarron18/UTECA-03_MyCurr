=======	The Beginnings	====================================

----------------------
The Big Mental Model
----------------------
*Data-generating mechanisms (generators) are based in reality
	Statistical science models the data-generating mechanisms through probability distributions and 
	stochastic processes.These models and other inferences are ESTIMATES OF REALITY and are functions of 
	the generator outputs (aka information or data values).  
	means that they inherit variability from the underlying stochastic process.

*Data-generating mechanisms (generators) produce information (aka data) over time. What is observable?


*We never know the full probability distribution of the variables we are dealing with.
	Statisticians often pretend that we have gone to the Oracle, and in a mystic trance they have 
	revealed to us the full joint probability distribution of X and Y , or at least the exact values of
	all of their moments. As in many mathematical problems, therefore, we have idealized away everything 
	inconvenient. Even the idea that the variables we see are "randomly generated from a probability 
	distribution" is a usually-untestable assumption. Rather than exact knowledge from the Oracle, we 
	have only a limited number of noisy samples from the reality-based data-generating mechanism 
	(aka sampling distribution).
	
My Comment: Statistics in general  Assumes that a) the phenomenon already exists and b) is observable and c) is
measurable. If the system under study is non-stationary and creates new subsets by i)
differentiation of the whole (morphogenesis) or ii) emergence, what is the value of the sampling?
Likewise, what if the system exhibits path dependence and becomes subject to a bifurcation
point. What then is the value of the sampling data? Law confesses,”... stochastic processes for most real (-world) systems do not have steady-state distributions since characteristics of the system change over time.” (p 493)Law, Averill M. 2006.

---NOTES "Cosma_StatsTextbook.pdf"-----

	1.1 Statistics, Data Analysis, Regression
		Statistics, then, uses probability to model (statistical) inference from data.
	
	6.1 Stochastic Models, Uncertainty, Sampling Distributions
		We thus model the data-generating mechanism through probability distributions and stochastic processes.
		Since a function of a function is a “functional”, and these quantities are functions of the true probability distribution function, we’ll call these functionals or statistical functionals1 . Functionals
could be single numbers (like the total rat population), or vectors, or even whole curves (like the expected time-course of temperature over the year, or the regression of hawks now on rats earlier). 

Statistical inference becomes estimating those functionals, or testing hypotheses about them. Most writers in theoretical statistics just call them “parameters” in a generalized sense, but I will try to restrict that word to actual parameters specifying statistical models, to minimize confusion.
These estimates and other inferences are functions of the data values, which means that they inherit variability from the underlying stochastic process.

Student in Kolmogorov set theoretic probability. Given the events E, F, and G provide set theoretic expressions for the following:
a) only F occurs
b) both E and F occur but not G
c) at least one event occurs
d) at least two events occur
e) all three events occur
f) no event occurs
g) at most one event occurs
h) at most two events occur

a) Only F occurs
This means:
    F occurs
    E does not occur
    G does not occur

Set-theoretic expression:
	F ∩ Ec ∩ Gc


b) Both E and F occur, but not G
This means:
    E and F occur
    G does not occur

Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∩ F ∩ Gc


c) At least one event occurs
This is the union of all three events.

Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∪ F ∪ G
	

d) At least two events occur
This means:
    Any two or all three of the events occur

We take all intersections of pairs and the intersection of all three:
	(E∩F) ∪ (E∩G) ∪ (F∩G)

(Note: this includes the region where all three occur, which satisfies "at least two.")


e) All three events occur
	All of E, F, and G occur together.

Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∩ F ∩ G
	
	
f) None of the events occurs
	This means none of E, F, or G occur.

Set-theoretic expression:
	Ec ∩ Fc ∩ Gc


g) At most one event occurs
This includes the cases:

    No event occurs
    Exactly one of E, F, or G occurs

We break it down into disjoint regions:
    None occurs: Ec ∩ Fc ∩ Gc

    Only E occurs: E ∩ Fc ∩ Gc

    Only F occurs: F ∩ Ec ∩ Gc

    Only G occurs: G ∩ Ec ∩ Fc

Set-theoretic expression:
	(Ec∩Fc∩Gc) ∪ (E∩Fc∩Gc) ∪ (Ec∩F∩Gc) ∪ (Ec∩Fc∩G)
	
	
h) At most two events occur
This includes:
    No events occur
    Exactly one event occurs
    Exactly two events occur
    (Only excludes the case where all three occur)

So we take the complement of the intersection of all three:
Set-theoretic expression:
	(E∩F∩G)c



Certainly! Below are the set-theoretic expressions for each scenario using the events \( E \), \( F \), and \( G \):

### a) Only \( F \) occurs
This means \( F \) occurs, but neither \( E \) nor \( G \) occurs.
\[
F \cap E^c \cap G^c
\]

### b) Both \( E \) and \( F \) occur but not \( G \)
This is the intersection of \( E \) and \( F \) minus \( G \).
\[
E \cap F \cap G^c
\]

### c) At least one event occurs
This is the union of all three events.
\[
E \cup F \cup G
\]

### d) At least two events occur
This means any two or all three events occur. There are three possible pairs and one triple:
\[
(E \cap F) \cup (E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G)
\]

### e) All three events occur
This is the intersection of all three events.
\[
E \cap F \cap G
\]

### f) No event occurs
This is the complement of the union of all events (i.e., none of \( E \), \( F \), or \( G \) occurs).
\[
(E \cup F \cup G)^c \quad \text{or} \quad E^c \cap F^c \cap G^c
\]

### g) At most one event occurs
This means either no event occurs, or exactly one of \( E \), \( F \), or \( G \) occurs. It can be expressed as:
\[
(E^c \cap F^c \cap G^c) \cup (E \cap F^c \cap G^c) \cup (F \cap E^c \cap G^c) \cup (G \cap E^c \cap F^c)
\]
Alternatively, it's the complement of "at least two events occur":
\[
(E \cap F)^c \cap (E \cap G)^c \cap (F \cap G)^c
\]

### h) At most two events occur
This means the scenario where all three events do **not** occur simultaneously. It's the complement of "all three events occur":
\[
(E \cap F \cap G)^c
\]
Alternatively, it can be expressed as the union of all possible cases where zero, one, or two events occur.

### Summary (in LaTex):
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{a) } F \cap E^c \cap G^c \\
&\text{b) } E \cap F \cap G^c \\
&\text{c) } E \cup F \cup G \\
&\text{d) } (E \cap F) \cup (E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G) \\
&\text{e) } E \cap F \cap G \\
&\text{f) } (E \cup F \cup G)^c \text{ or } E^c \cap F^c \cap G^c \\
&\text{g) } (E \cap F)^c \cap (E \cap G)^c \cap (F \cap G)^c \\
&\text{h) } (E \cap F \cap G)^c \\
\end{aligned}
}
