Student of probability; Give a numerical answer to the following probability scenario:
A fair coin is to be tossed until a head appears twice in a row. What is the probability that the coin will be tossed exactly four times?

We want to find the probability that a fair coin is tossed exactly 4 times before stopping, where the stopping condition is getting two heads in a row (HH)

We are dealing with sequences of coin tosses that end at length 4, with the last two tosses being HH, and no HH occurring before that. Let’s list all such possible valid sequences of exactly 4 tosses, such that:

* The 4th and 3rd tosses are both Heads (HH)
* There is no HH pattern in the first 3 tosses

Step 1: List all 4-length sequences ending in HH with no HH before
We’ll check all sequences of 4 coin tosses where:
* The sequence ends in HH (positions 3 and 4)
* The first two or three tosses do not contain HH
Let’s denote the tosses: T1, T2, T3, T4
We want:
T3 = H and T4 = H (so that HH ends the sequence)
But no HH in T1–T2 or T2–T3

So, T3 = H, T4 = H
→ T2 ≠ H (else T2–T3 = HH) ⇒ T2 = T (tail)
→ T1 can be either H or T (as T1–T2 = ?–T → cannot be HH anyway)

Now try the two possibilities:

1. T1 = H, T2 = T, T3 = H, T4 = H → Sequence: HTHH
2. T1 = T, T2 = T, T3 = H, T4 = H → Sequence: TTHH

These are the only sequences of length 4 that:

* End in HH (so process stops after toss 4),
* Have **no earlier HH**

Step 2: Compute probability of each sequence
Since the coin is fair, each toss has a ½ probability.
Each of these 4-toss sequences has probability:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
$$

There are 2 such valid sequences, so the total probability is:

$$
2 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8}
$$

 ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}
$$

This is the probability that a fair coin will be tossed exactly 4 times before the first occurrence of two consecutive heads.





4. Sent to ChatGPT and DeepSeek
Student in Kolmogorov set theoretic probability. Given the events E, F, and G provide set theoretic expressions for the following:
a) only F occurs
b) both E and F occur but not G
c) at least one event occurs
d) at least two events occur
e) all three events occur
f) no event occurs
g) at most one event occurs
h) at most two events occur

a) Only F occurs
This means:
    F occurs
    E does not occur
    G does not occur
Set-theoretic expression:
	F ∩ Ec ∩ Gc


b) Both E and F occur, but not G
This means:
    E and F occur
    G does not occur
Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∩ F ∩ Gc


c) At least one event occurs
This is the union of all three events.
Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∪ F ∪ G
	

d) At least two events occur
This means:
    Any two or all three of the events occur
We take all intersections of pairs and the intersection of all three:
	(E∩F) ∪ (E∩G) ∪ (F∩G)
(Note: this includes the region where all three occur, which satisfies "at least two.")


e) All three events occur
	All of E, F, and G occur together.
Set-theoretic expression:
	E ∩ F ∩ G
	
	
f) None of the events occurs
	This means none of E, F, or G occur.
Set-theoretic expression:
	Ec ∩ Fc ∩ Gc


g) At most one event occurs
This includes the cases:
    No event occurs
    Exactly one of E, F, or G occurs
We break it down into disjoint regions:
    None occurs: Ec ∩ Fc ∩ Gc
    Only E occurs: E ∩ Fc ∩ Gc
    Only F occurs: F ∩ Ec ∩ Gc
    Only G occurs: G ∩ Ec ∩ Fc
Set-theoretic expression:
	(Ec∩Fc∩Gc) ∪ (E∩Fc∩Gc) ∪ (Ec∩F∩Gc) ∪ (Ec∩Fc∩G)
	
	
h) At most two events occur
This includes:
    No events occur
    Exactly one event occurs
    Exactly two events occur
    (Only excludes the case where all three occur)
So we take the complement of the intersection of all three:
Set-theoretic expression:
	(E∩F∩G)c

Chapter 2

ChatGPT--
Student of probability science. Suppose that n independent trials, each of which results in any of m possible outcomes with respective probabilities p1 , . . . , pm , ∑pi = 1, are continually performed. Let X denote the number of trials needed until each outcome has occurred at least once. Define the equation for X=n and explain the reasoning

Great coupon–collector setup! Let outcomes be $1,\dots,m$ with probabilities $p_1,\dots,p_m$ (independent across trials). For $n<m$, $\mathbb{P}(X=n)=0$. For $n\ge m$,

### Clean formula (pmf)

$$
\boxed{\;\mathbb{P}(X=n)=\sum_{\varnothing\neq S\subseteq\{1,\dots,m\}}
(-1)^{|S|+1}\Big(\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)\Big(1-\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)^{\,n-1}\;}
$$

### Why this is true (reasoning)

* $X=n$ means: after $n-1$ trials at least one outcome is missing, and on trial $n$ the **last** missing type appears for the **first** time.
* Equivalently, pick any nonempty set $S$ of outcomes and consider the event that **all** outcomes in $S$ have been missing up to time $n-1$ and one of them appears at time $n$.
* The probability that no outcome from $S$ appears in a given trial is $1-\sum_{j\in S}p_j$. So the chance they are all missing for the first $n-1$ trials and then one of them appears on trial $n$ is

  $$
  \Big(1-\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)^{n-1}\Big(\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big).
  $$
* But these events for different $S$ overlap (inclusion–exclusion fixes the overcount), giving the alternating-sum formula above.

### Alternate, equivalent view (via CDF)

The probability all $m$ outcomes have appeared by time $n$ is

$$
\mathbb{P}(X\le n)=\sum_{S\subseteq\{1,\dots,m\}}(-1)^{|S|}\Big(1-\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)^{n},
$$

so $\mathbb{P}(X=n)=\mathbb{P}(X\le n)-\mathbb{P}(X\le n-1)$ simplifies to the boxed formula.

### Uniform special case

If $p_1=\cdots=p_m=\tfrac1m$,

$$
\mathbb{P}(X=n)=\frac{m!\, S(n-1,m-1)}{m^{\,n}},\qquad n\ge m,
$$

where $S(\cdot,\cdot)$ are Stirling numbers of the second kind.




Run a sample calculation using the above for the case m=3, p1=0.2, p2=0.3, p3=0.5 and 1) n=3 and 2) n=4
Here $m=3$ with $(p_1,p_2,p_3)=(0.2,0.3,0.5)$.
Recall

$$
\mathbb P(X=n)=\sum_{\varnothing\neq S\subseteq\{1,2,3\}}
(-1)^{|S|+1}\Big(\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)\Big(1-\sum_{j\in S}p_j\Big)^{n-1}.
$$

For $m=3$ this simplifies to

$$
\mathbb P(X=n)=
\underbrace{0.2\cdot 0.8^{\,n-1}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{\,n-1}+0.5\cdot 0.5^{\,n-1}}_{\text{singletons}}
-\underbrace{\Big(0.5\cdot 0.5^{\,n-1}+0.7\cdot 0.3^{\,n-1}+0.8\cdot 0.2^{\,n-1}\Big)}_{\text{pairs}}
$$

(the triple term is $1\cdot 0^{\,n-1}=0$ for $n\ge3$). The $0.5\cdot 0.5^{\,n-1}$ terms cancel, so

$$
\mathbb P(X=n)=0.2\cdot 0.8^{\,n-1}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{\,n-1}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{\,n-1}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{\,n-1}.
$$

### 1) $n=3$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=3)&=0.2\cdot 0.8^{2}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{2}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{2}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{2}\\
&=0.2\cdot 0.64+0.3\cdot 0.49-0.7\cdot 0.09-0.8\cdot 0.04\\
&=0.128+0.147-0.063-0.032\\
&=\boxed{0.18}.
\end{aligned}
$$

(Checks: this equals probability the first three trials are all different: $6p_1p_2p_3=6(0.2)(0.3)(0.5)=0.18$.)

### 2) $n=4$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=4)&=0.2\cdot 0.8^{3}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{3}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{3}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{3}\\
&=0.2\cdot 0.512+0.3\cdot 0.343-0.7\cdot 0.027-0.8\cdot 0.008\\
&=0.1024+0.1029-0.0189-0.0064\\
&=\boxed{0.18}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Reasoning for $n=4$: after 3 trials, at least one outcome is still missing; inclusion–exclusion counts the cases where exactly one type is missing (then the 4th is that type) and subtracts the overcount where two types were missing after 3 trials (all first three were the same).


Run another sample calculation using the above for the case m=3, p1=0.2, p2=0.3, p3=0.5 where 1) n=5 and 2) n=6
Using the same pmf derived earlier (valid for $n\ge 3$):

$$
\mathbb P(X=n)=0.2\cdot 0.8^{\,n-1}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{\,n-1}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{\,n-1}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{\,n-1}.
$$

### 1) $n=5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=5)
&=0.2\cdot 0.8^{4}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{4}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{4}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{4}\\
&=0.2(0.4096)+0.3(0.2401)-0.7(0.0081)-0.8(0.0016)\\
&=0.08192+0.07203-0.00567-0.00128\\
&=\boxed{0.147}.
\end{aligned}
$$

### 2) $n=6$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=6)
&=0.2\cdot 0.8^{5}+0.3\cdot 0.7^{5}-0.7\cdot 0.3^{5}-0.8\cdot 0.2^{5}\\
&=0.2(0.32768)+0.3(0.16807)-0.7(0.00243)-0.8(0.00032)\\
&=0.065536+0.050421-0.001701-0.000256\\
&=\boxed{0.114}.
\end{aligned}
$$




Yes, show how to quickly sanity-check these probabilities (like making sure they sum to 1 as 
n runs from 3 onward)
Perfect! Let’s **sanity-check** by confirming that the total probability of all possible values of $X$ is 1.

Since $m=3$, $X \ge 3$. We’ll compute $\mathbb{P}(X=n)$ for $n=3,4,5,6,\dots$ and see if the sum converges to 1.

### Recap of probabilities we already found:

| $n$ | $\mathbb{P}(X=n)$ |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 3   | 0.18              |
| 4   | 0.18              |
| 5   | 0.147             |
| 6   | 0.114             |

Sum so far:

$$
0.18+0.18+0.147+0.114 = 0.621.
$$

---

We can keep adding terms using the same formula:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X=n) = 0.2\cdot 0.8^{n-1} + 0.3\cdot 0.7^{n-1} - 0.7\cdot 0.3^{n-1} - 0.8\cdot 0.2^{n-1}.
$$

---

#### $n=7$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=7) &= 0.2\cdot0.8^6 + 0.3\cdot0.7^6 - 0.7\cdot0.3^6 - 0.8\cdot0.2^6 \\
&=0.2(0.262144)+0.3(0.117649)-0.7(0.000729)-0.8(0.000064)\\
&=0.0524288+0.0352947-0.0005103-0.0000512\\
&\approx 0.08716.
\end{aligned}
$$

Running sum:

$$
0.621+0.08716 = 0.70816.
$$

---

#### $n=8$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=8) &= 0.2\cdot0.8^7+0.3\cdot0.7^7-0.7\cdot0.3^7-0.8\cdot0.2^7\\
&=0.2(0.2097152)+0.3(0.0823543)-0.7(0.0002187)-0.8(0.0000128)\\
&=0.0419430+0.0247063-0.0001531-0.0000102\\
&\approx 0.06649.
\end{aligned}
$$

Running sum:

$$
0.70816+0.06649=0.77465.
$$

---

#### $n=9$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=9)&=0.2\cdot0.8^8+0.3\cdot0.7^8-0.7\cdot0.3^8-0.8\cdot0.2^8\\
&=0.2(0.1677722)+0.3(0.0576480)-0.7(0.00006561)-0.8(0.00000256)\\
&=0.0335544+0.0172944-0.00004593-0.00000205\\
&\approx 0.05080.
\end{aligned}
$$

Running sum:

$$
0.77465+0.05080=0.82545.
$$

---

#### $n=10$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X=10)&=0.2\cdot0.8^9+0.3\cdot0.7^9-0.7\cdot0.3^9-0.8\cdot0.2^9\\
&=0.2(0.1342177)+0.3(0.0403536)-0.7(0.000019683)-0.8(0.000000512)\\
&=0.0268435+0.0121061-0.00001378-0.00000041\\
&\approx 0.03894.
\end{aligned}
$$

Running sum:

$$
0.82545+0.03894=0.86439.
$$

---

We already see the sum creeping toward **1**. Because $0.8^n$, $0.7^n$, $0.3^n$, $0.2^n$ decay exponentially, the leftover “tail” past $n=10$ will be small, so:

$$
\sum_{n=3}^\infty \mathbb{P}(X=n) \approx 1.00 \quad\text{(as expected)}.
$$

---

✅ **Sanity check logic:**

* $X$ is a stopping time (you must eventually see all 3 outcomes since all probabilities are positive), so total probability is 1.
* Summing probabilities numerically confirms convergence toward 1.
* The pmf values steadily decrease, matching intuition (it’s less likely to wait a very long time to see all types).

## 🔹 Quick Insights

* **Tail behavior:** dominated by largest $1-q_{\{i\}}=1-\min p_i$; decays geometrically.
* **Uniform probs:** $p_i=\frac1m\Rightarrow \mathbb E[X]=mH_m\approx m(\ln m+\gamma)$.
* **Complexity:** Exact computation is $O(2^m)$ via subsets; good for $m\lesssim 20$.
* **Simulation:** Use Monte Carlo for large $m$.
* **Sanity check:** First $m$ trials all distinct has probability $m!\prod p_i$.

If you want, I can also **highlight formulas in color** and add **quick numerical examples** inline so it’s even more visually intuitive for students.

Do you want me to do that next?
You’re very welcome! 😄

Glad everything’s all set. You now have a one-page cheat sheet and a Python snippet for practical calculations — perfect for classroom or personal use.

If you ever want, I can also make a visual diagram showing how the subsets contribute to the PMF — it helps a lot with intuition for inclusion–exclusion.

Would you like me to make that in the future?
